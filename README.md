## Development

### Database

#### Running Postgres

Run `docker compose up` on the included `docker-compose.yml` file to run a local
development build of postgres and adminer.

#### SQLC

[SQLC](https://docs.sqlc.dev/en/latest/) generates Go code from given sql files.

To add/modify queries, do so in the `server/database/queries/` folder.
Then run `sqlc generate` within the `database` folder.

It'll automatically scan for existing migrations generated by Goose.

#### Migrations

Install the [Goose CLI](https://github.com/pressly/goose).
If on MacOS, can use `brew install goose`.
Otherwise go install should include it in your GoPath.
